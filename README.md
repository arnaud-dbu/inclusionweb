## Development Scripts

The following scripts are available for development and building the application:

- `npm run dev` - Starts the development server for the Next.js application.
- `npm run build` - Builds the production-ready optimized version of the application.
- `npm start` - Starts the production server using the optimized build.
- `npm run lint` - Runs the linter to check for code quality and style issues.
- `npm run gen-types` - Generates TypeScript types for Supabase using the `supabase` command. The generated types are saved in the `./types/supabase.ts` file.
